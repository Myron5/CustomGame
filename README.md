<h1 align='center'>🎮 Custom Game 👾</h1>

<h2>  💻 Setup</h2>
<ul>
  <li>  Unzip the file <code>EXE.zip</code> <a href="https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/Myron5/CustomGame/tree/main/EXE">Download</a></li>
  <li>  Run the file <code>main.exe</code></li>
</ul>

<h2>  📜 About the purpose</h2>
<p>  🔹 I created this project to train skills with <code>pygame</code>. Maybe some of you don't like video games because you can't change the map to your liking. (I think there are very few of them, but still) Thanks to this program, you will increase your dopamine and creativity: you will try to play a game whose map you yourself created.</p>

<h2>  👨‍💻 About the program</h2>
<p>  🔹 First, the program starts the <code>level editor</code> in which you create a location in order to start playing. Be sure to place the main character (texture #15) on the map, without it the play button does not work, and at least one opponent (texture #16) so that the game does not immediately end with your winnings.<br> Then press the play button. Everything is ready, enjoy the game and try to kill all opponents to win.</p>
